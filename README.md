Hello! I do work in the areas of machine learning, physics, and software development. I also work on improving methods for testing for scientific/research software, and am a maintainer for [the Hypothesis testing library](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I am passionate about education, and created the CogWorks course at the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute as well as the website [Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/). 

### Libraries for accelerating and improving ML research

- [hydra-zen](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen): Making Hydra more pythonic and easier to use at-scale for ML workflows and expriments
- [responsible-ai-toolbox](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/responsible-ai-toolbox): PyTorch-centric library for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of AI technologies.

### Other open source projects

- [MyGrad](https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad): Drop-in automatic differentiation for NumPy
- [noggin](https://github.com/rsokl/noggin): A simple tool for logging and plotting metrics in real time
- [custom_inherit](https://github.com/rsokl/custom_inherit): inheriting and merging docstrings in customizable ways (my first ever open source project!)
